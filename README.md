## Single-Layer Perceptron for Logic Gate Simulation
This project implements a Single-Layer Perceptron in Python to perform binary classification and simulate logic gates using a step activation function. The perceptron is first tested on a simple classification problem and then extended to model basic and complex logic gates, such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR.


### üìå Objectives
Implement a Single-Layer Perceptron with a step activation function.

Train and test the model on simple binary classification tasks.

Simulate basic logic gates: AND, OR, NOT.

Simulate complex logic gates: NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib (optional for plotting results)
