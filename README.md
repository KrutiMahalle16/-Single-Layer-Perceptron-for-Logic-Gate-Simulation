## Single-Layer Perceptron for Logic Gate Simulation
This project implements a Single-Layer Perceptron in Python to perform binary classification and simulate logic gates using a step activation function. The perceptron is first tested on a simple classification problem and then extended to model basic and complex logic gates, such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR.
